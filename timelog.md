## Week 2
### 4 Oct 2021
* *2 hours* Reaserched Pathology GAN and related models for representation learning

### 5 Oct 2021
* *2 hours* Researched clustering techniques for high dimensional data
* *1 hour* Came up with an appropriate scope for the project based on the feasibility of completing the project within the timeframe of the academic year 

### 6 Oct 2021
* *1 hour* Came up with a high level pipeline which could be used to structure/cluster unsupervised data
* *1 hour* Researched potential evaluation metrics to evaluate image clusters

### 10 Oct 2021
* *0.5 hour* Set up Zotero and transfered all the references so far to Zotero


## Week 3
### 11 Oct 2021
* *1 hour* Go over the paper N2D: (Not Too) Deep Clustering via Clustering the Local Manifold of an Autoencoded Embedding

### 12 Oct 2021
* *2 hours* Researched about prinipal component analysis along with potential pipelines to use it for clustering

### 13 Oct 2021
* *1 hour* Researched about H5py file format and read the documentation
* *0.5 hour* Set up a jupyter notebook for experimentation on the data

### 14 October 2021
* *1 hour* Explorde the dataset
* *1 hours* Wrote a script to match the image representation data to the patient mutation data based on barcode

### 15 October 2021
* *2 hours* Explored the principal components of the data and visualized the trends about the variance of different number of principal components
* *2 hours* Plotted kmeans inertia scores with different k numbers to figure out best number of centroids for 2 principal components which show most variance
* *1 hour* Ran kmeans with the 2 principal components
*
### 16 October 2021
* *2 hours* Visualized the clusters and centroids and tried to come up with theories based on what I saw
