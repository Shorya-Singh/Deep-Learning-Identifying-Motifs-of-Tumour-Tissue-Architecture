* Identifying Motifs of Tumour Tissue Architecture with Deep Representation Learning
* Shorya Singh
* 2224727s
* Dr Ke Yuan

Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Start researching the topic and the problem and come up initial ideas about project scope; research about representation learning
* **Week 2** Come up with a potential pipeline for the project to be discussed with the supervisor; research GANs and PathologyGAN
* **Week 3** Explore the dataset, research further into the potential clustering and analysis methods, and run an initial clustering analysis 
* **Week 4** Include appropriate measures to analyse the cluster quality and provide an initial mapping of the clusters to patient data
* **Week 5** Implement the deep clustering method as described in DEC(Xie et al.) 
* **Week 6** Implement dimentionality reduction described in N2D (McConville et al.) 
* **Week 7** Perform DEC using representations from different models
* **Week 8** Analyse the performance of DEC with different representations using appropriate metrics
* **Week 9** Map cluster spaces to gene mutation data to find patterns
* **Week 10** Visualization for mappings, statistical testing for gene mutation patterns 
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]** Initial downstream analysis with different dimensionality reductions, cluster spaces and representation models 
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
