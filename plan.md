Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1** Start researching the topic and the problem and come up initial ideas about project scope; research about representation learning
* **Week 2** Come up with a potential pipeline for the project to be discussed with the supervisor; research GANs and PathologyGAN
* **Week 3** Explore the dataset, research further into the potential clustering and analysis methods, and run an initial clustering analysis 
* **Week 4** Implement the deep clustering method as described in DEC(Xie et al.) and analyse the results
* **Week 5** Implement some dimentionality reductions and run clustering using methods described in N2D (McConville et al.) 
* **Week 6**
* **Week 7**
* **Week 8**
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
